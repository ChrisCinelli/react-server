# Roadmap

In addition to keeping up with the [issues](https://github.com/redfin/react-server/issues),
we plan to add the following page api methods:


`getCanonicalUrl(next: Function), optional: String | Promise(String)`

* **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

* A string (or promise thereof) that is the canonical URL for this webpage

* Default: no canonical URL header added.


If you have other feature requests, please file them in the
[issue queue](https://github.com/redfin/react-server/issues).
